ðŸ“ˆ AI-Powered Trading Assistant (Browser Extension)
Technologies: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, TradingView integration, Real-time WebSocket, AI APIs (planned), Firebase (for auth/logging), Python (future backtesting modules)

Description:
This project is a browser extension designed to assist intraday traders by offering real-time market insights, AI-driven trade analysis, and interactive screen sharing directly on platforms like TradingView. The assistant reads the chart view, listens to user voice/text prompts, and returns insights such as risk zones, trend summaries, volume spikes, and real-time alerts.

Key Features:

âœ… Live screen sharing among teammates (for co-trading and collaboration)

âœ… Context-aware AI prompts ("Should I exit this long?", "Is RSI diverging here?")

âœ… Fetches and summarizes on-chart technicals (RSI, EMAs, MACD)

âœ… Integrates user-provided external market news and data (planned)

âœ… Designed for scalping & intraday strategies (15min / 1min focus)

Currently being developed as a lightweight browser extension with plans for future deployment as a standalone web app or plugin.
